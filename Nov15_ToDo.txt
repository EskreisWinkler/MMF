KONDOR TO DO LIST

- I have shown that reasonable predictions can be made using a GP.
- A slow ingredient is the parameter search (even on just the monthly data) so we want to consider the evaluation of fminsearch using a marginal likelihood function that incorporates MMF.
- Once this process is sped up, compare the relative performance of the regular procedure to the MMF one.
