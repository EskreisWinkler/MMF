FOR TOMORROW:
	- Resolve remaining compiling issues of MMF on aitken. Contact Pramod?
	- Copy ONeil chart for MMF.
		- include a chart of MMF parameters as predictors of accuracy/timing
	- is this analogous to a message passing algorithm?
	- testing behavior of mmf on kayley graph to see if we recover something that looks like FFT
	- useful for community detection?
