KONDOR TO DO LIST

FOR TOMORROW:
	- Attempt to compile MMF code on aitken machine
	- Copy ONeil chart for MMF.
		- include a chart of MMF parameters as predictors of accuracy/timing
	- is this analogous to a message passing algorithm?
	- testing behavior of mmf on kayley graph to see if we recover something that looks like FFT
	- useful for community detection?
