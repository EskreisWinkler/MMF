A very specific and organized guide to the work that was done by JME over break. 
Was getting a bit over my head with Irish wind. 
There are a few objectives for winter break.
	(1) Study the basic parameters of the MMF model. Need to use the documentation that was already written up about the parameters. Can use simple kernel matrices over a grid, or a cluster within a grid, see how parameters matter. When are features captured? When are they not?
	(2) Study simpler examples of GPR and confirm MMF can perform
	(3) Re-apply MMF to Irish wind with growing levels of complexity in terms of number of parameters and in terms of number of datapoints. Eventually we may want to parallelize this.
	(4) Begin looking into community detection. Identify key papers
	(5) Reading: Need heavily notated MMF paper. Can do this in St. John.  
	(6) Update Kondor with progress pre-St. John?
